So conceptually, the model probably already knows whatever you want it to do. It just doesn't necessarily have the attachment with the captions.

Say for example BeatriXL is having problems; where if I type 1girl I often end up with NSFW elements. I can't simply just, train 1girl directly and expect it to only show sfw elements, without lobotomizing the damn model. I also can't simply just negative the safe, questionable, explicit, etc; because they are required for fidelity and quality.

https://github.com/p1atdev/LECO

The LECO by concept is inherently HIGHLY destructive - originally adopted to make the earlier SD1.5 "slider" concepts; where one thing extreme passes in one direction or the other.

Well, as you can see by the repo it's 2 years unpatched. I looked around and found almost no replacements here, not any realistic ones anyway. So I've decided - to reimplement the slider for SDXL. Getting this notebook working involved a series of specific library selections, specific "monkey patch" additions thanks to O3 being odd, library noise replacements, and more - without patching the actual code of the library or creating a module.

## LOBA
I'm fond of the name "lobotomy" since we're inherently lobotomizing the AI. If you use LOBA you'll know exactly what you're doing to your AI model - introducing the mad science experiment into it. d... don't merge it... Or -O or do, y'know up to you. I'll put merge functions. Wait until it's more advanced.

Anyway.

### Lets make a WAY better LECO.
Conceptually, this is a good idea by concept, but the LECO implementation is sorely lacking for the current era. The early implementation of the LECO does not support masked loss, proper vpred loss for sdxl, bucketing, MIN_SNR, gamma noise additions, additional loss type huber L1 or L2 calculations, flux slider controllers, or any of the other more modern options that seem crucial to keep a model from collapsing into itself.

I'll follow the standard LORA and full funetune formatting and options alongside the new system, producing a utilizable and cluster deployable trainer in it's later stages due to utilizing huggingface_hub and diffusers in conjunction with additional offloading procedures specialized for larger training clusters.

Standard loras will be as trainable without destruction. I'm utilizing powerful pro-tools in a very ease-of-organization method for everyone to directly deploy on colab, runpod, windows machines, linux machines, macOS and more.

Programs like this don't exist for good reason.
Usually programs like this aren't finished because the developers either lose sight, get burned out, or face some sort of technical or hardware limitation based on their concepts.

On top of the technical aspects, there's a negative stigma to unlearning. I've learned enough in the last couple years to provide careful training methodologies built into a trainer.

Well, we have all those to conquer as stepping stones to the goal; parity.

We will create training parity with the LOBA, not just with standard LORA training being completely obliterated in quality by the LOBA trainer using sd-scripts directly, or the LOBA trainer monkey-patched to support github repos like that.

I can pull this one off, because of 5 core reasons here;
1. **huggingface_hub** supports everything major needed without deep technical requirements.

   This did not exist when sd-scripts spawned, but it does now. Hard to say how long this will last.

2. **Robust libraries** support all the necessary back-end traits that are required, we don't need anything too deeply technical or difficult here - just a patchwork integration.

   Many libraries simply did not exist last year, or the year before. Some trainers support them, this will support MANY.

3. **Time limitations** and difficulties of logistics tend to shatter programs like this. The developers are limited and the time is difficult to manage, however with programs like GPT O3, Claude, and Gemini; I can pull this off on my own with minimal mental overhead and minimal headaches - as long as I focus the AI specifically on the target goals.

   One person doing 20 people's jobs, that's the opposite of a 20x dev. A 20x dev introduces 20x more job requirements under them to produce what they need. I'm the opposite - speed and optimization only. One person doing 20 jobs with the assistance of high-grade AI systems.

4. **Hardware constraints** have always been an ongoing issue with many systems. I have multiple local devices that can be utilized in tests, and the primary program will be running based on colab with the scaled up form running based on tests.

5. **The wide net policy**. Generally speaking, if you use only what may or may not work, you'll end up with the outcome from what may or may not work. sd-scripts is notorious for training everything without discrimination with open-ended ideas, but the implementation is limited - but that doesn't make it any less useful. Instead of focusing on just one mule, I'll distribute focus based on the task to carefully delegate imports - then run comparative checks using multiple AI to regenerate multiple sets of requirements based on machine types. I'll then test using ai and machines themselves, but there's many elements that cannot be accounted for, and many systems that simply will skirt the clauses, so I have to be vigilant over time.

### Colab LOBA trainer first, others later.
LOBA looks a lot like a LECO except y'know, not like it. We're adopting the LECO style of training while replacing a bunch of stuff around it.

Technically a LECO is just a Lora with a hat on it, so we're just preparing lora-style weights with a dash of controlnet.

### HEAVY use of huggingface_hub
The majority of the systems will be implemented based on `from_pretrained`, and we'll unload in careful methodological ways - often considered safe and utilizable over larger scale.

Additionally, we'll implement accelerate with ulysses ring support - to enable full large-scale training with a huggingface diffusers pipeline to utilize the refactored and robust library that will result from this next generation trainer.
